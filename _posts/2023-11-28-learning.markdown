1. Nobody teaches you.
2. You don't know what you want, what you need, or 
     what you may need.
3. You can't say that someone didn't teach you this or 
     that.
4. And you should not give a reason, saying this or that.
5. You will not always have a teacher, mentor, or guru.
6. The responsibility to learn and understand is yours.
7. It is your responsibility not to be absorbed in your past and past failures.
