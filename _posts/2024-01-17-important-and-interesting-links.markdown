Okay, hey,

This is the blog that I’m writing after a long time. I decided to do it as a note for myself and anybody who wants to read it. Note: This page will be updated from time to time, so it's better to keep an eye on this page/note.

Umm, this blog is a result of inspiration from many people, and it serves as an index of links. It is open for suggestions, so let’s start. Also, "why are these links important?" You will get the answer to these questions when you explore the links. There are so many things I have to share, and this blog is one of them. Some links might have the links to other, I am mentioning them anyway; might create a new blog for books later.

One thing to note here is, 'hacker' in these list is 'hacker'(read the below links) not the 'cracker'
