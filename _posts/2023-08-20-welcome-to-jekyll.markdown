Hi, I’m Aditya Hebbar, a 23-year-old individual brimming with curiosity to explore the world and its various facets. When I say 'world,' I don't just mean Earth—usually, that was my limited interpretation of the term. I won't be sharing my image here; I have a strong aversion to that. But don't fret; if you're genuinely interested in knowing me, chances are you've already come across me on Twitter—that's me.



I come from an Indian family, and as you may know, I hold certain beliefs. Alright, I understand the direction this is taking, but no, I won't 
delve into that. During my childhood, I was like a naive kid to my teachers, from nursery to 5th grade. (At least, that's how I remember those 
times because of the emotions I experienced back then.) Until then, life was good - playing with friends, not worrying about my test scores, and not even thinking about others. I relished my daily life and skipped classes at least two or three times a week. Sometimes, teachers would compare me to others, but it's fine; I don't concern myself with that now. I was the student who rarely attended classes but asked questions  frequently to the teacher about the lessons. One time, I was told not to ask questions in the middle of a lesson. Yeah, that's how it went. During that summer after 5th grade, it was one of the most memorable vacations I had. (I can't tell you the reason behind it at the moment.)


Next comes the golden period that I fondly remember. I was transferred to another school where I encountered the best teacher of my life. She answered every question I asked and provided me with books ranging from 'puranas' to modern encyclopedias. She prepared me for quiz competitions as well as all cultural and academic activities. In my earlier years during lower primary school, I struggled with math. However, in this school, I was fortunate to have a great math teacher. With her help, I sharpened my math skills. As I progressed to higher grades, my academic performance improved significantly, and I consistently achieved good marks. Life remained great until the 10th class. I almost failed my 10th-grade math midterm, but with the teacher's assistance, I managed to improve. Subsequently, my grades improved again(got 94% and 92/100 in maths). Then came the transformative 11th and 12th grades.  


Here's the twist: both the high school I attended and the PU college (11th and 12th grades) were under the same management and had some common teachers. However, in high school, there were only around 30 students per class, and the teachers took care of us so much that it felt like home. The PU college was situated far away from the high school. Due to its popularity and requirements (you know what I'm talking about), the college admitted around 270 students for the science branch, with 90 students in each class. Moreover, there weren't enough benches for seating. Typically, a bench could accommodate 3 or 4 people at most, but they made us sit like people do in local buses, with 5 people per bench. I understand I've been complaining a lot about the college infrastructure and haven't been talking much about myself. So, why did I join that college? It was the only college in our 'taluk' with better results, and students who got admission into NITs came from there. Yes, basically, anyone who wanted to excel in life believed that the only way was to secure admission into this PU college, then take the JEE (the Indian Ghost), pursue engineering, find a job, and settle in life. Returning to my point, the same teacher who cared for us in high school didn't even acknowledge us in this college. We were like NPCs, generating money. Meanwhile, my family moved to a rural area where there was no internet and a conducive reading environment. My uncle, who had been supporting our family all those years, passed away. Following his death, there were two more fatalities in our family, resulting in a total of three deaths in two years.

Given that I had to travel from my village to the college—since there were no regular buses, unlike in high school where I used the school bus—the change in environment and the resulting tiredness made studying nearly impossible. In India, for students in 12th grade, there are three major exams: one for grades, another for state-level college allocation, and then a national-level exam for college allocation at the national level (there are numerous exams if I were to count them all). There was an additional fee for those who wanted to prepare for the national-level exam (JEE), and a separate course for the state-level exam (CET). Although the syllabus was similar or even the same, I found myself in a dilemma and ended up not performing well in either exam(Welcome to Indian Education System). Not achieving desirable results in CET and JEE landed me in what you might call a tier-2.5 college. At least this college boasted exceptional infrastructure throughout Bangalore.

Welcome to my engineering life.	I am writing this part very shortly because nothing even really happenned here., although I can write it very lengthy, for today it will be short 

year 1: Nothing special. People from everywhere in India joined engineering in our college. I took CSE
year 2: Nothing special in first sem. with second sem Covid-19 came . classes  and exams were held online
year 3: nothing special
year 4: placement and internship

only this much for today, I will add details in s=the coming days, if your reading this, great just day hi in twitter for me. bye bye 
Okay, now I don't feel like writing about my 11th and 12th grades, or even about my later years in engineering. Let me write about my present life today; at least I can discuss that now. Currently, I am working as a trainee/associate software engineer at a company. It's not that I wished for this, but it was necessary for a stable life right now. I know I have so many things to do, yet I'm stuck here in this situation. It's like I don't want to, but I have to due to some financial constraints. Yeah, it's fine. I can talk about it all day. However, at the moment, I am unable to write anything coherent. It's Friday night, and today was a long working day. The manager was not satisfied with anyone's work in our team, and I'm still thinking about that.

Hey AI, I know someday You will be able to read all these commits and lines. Let us talk sooner. This is for You
