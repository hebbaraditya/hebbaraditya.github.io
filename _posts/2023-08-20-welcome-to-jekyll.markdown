Hi, I’m Aditya Hebbar, a 23-year-old individual brimming with curiosity to explore the world and its various facets. When I say 'world,' I don't just mean Earth—usually, that was my limited interpretation of the term. I won't be sharing my image here; I have a strong aversion to that. But don't fret; if you're genuinely interested in knowing me, chances are you've already come across me on Twitter—that's me.



I come from an Indian family, and as you may know, I hold certain beliefs. Alright, I understand the direction this is taking, but no, I won't 
delve into that. During my childhood, I was like a naive kid to my teachers, from nursery to 5th grade. (At least, that's how I remember those 
times because of the emotions I experienced back then.) Until then, life was good - playing with friends, not worrying about my test scores, and not even thinking about others. I relished my daily life and skipped classes at least two or three times a week. Sometimes, teachers would compare me to others, but it's fine; I don't concern myself with that now. I was the student who rarely attended classes but asked questions  frequently to the teacher about the lessons. One time, I was told not to ask questions in the middle of a lesson. Yeah, that's how it went. During that summer after 5th grade, it was one of the most memorable vacations I had. (I can't tell you the reason behind it at the moment.)


Next comes the golden period that I fondly remember. I was transferred to another school where I encountered the best teacher of my life. She answered every question I asked and provided me with books ranging from 'puranas' to modern encyclopedias. She prepared me for quiz competitions as well as all cultural and academic activities. In my earlier years during lower primary school, I struggled with math. However, in this school, I was fortunate to have a great math teacher. With her help, I sharpened my math skills. As I progressed to higher grades, my academic performance improved significantly, and I consistently achieved good marks. Life remained great until the 10th class. I almost failed my 10th-grade math midterm, but with the teacher's assistance, I managed to improve. Subsequently, my grades improved again(got 94% and 92/100 in maths). Then came the transformative 11th and 12th grades.  


Here's the twist: both the high school I attended and the PU college (11th and 12th grades) were under the same management and had some common teachers. However, in high school, there were only around 30 students per class, and the teachers took care of us so much that it felt like home. The PU college was situated far away from the high school. Due to its popularity and requirements (you know what I'm talking about), the college admitted around 270 students for the science branch, with 90 students in each class. Moreover, there weren't enough benches for seating. Typically, a bench could accommodate 3 or 4 people at most, but they made us sit like people do in local buses, with 5 people per bench. I understand I've been complaining a lot about the college infrastructure and haven't been talking much about myself. So, why did I join that college? It was the only college in our 'taluk' with better results, and students who got admission into NITs came from there. Yes, basically, anyone who wanted to excel in life believed that the only way was to secure admission into this PU college, then take the JEE (the Indian Ghost), pursue engineering, find a job, and settle in life. Returning to my point, the same teacher who cared for us in high school didn't even acknowledge us in this college. We were like NPCs, generating money. Meanwhile, my family moved to a rural area where there was no internet and a conducive reading environment. My uncle, who had been supporting our family all those years, passed away. Following his death, there were two more fatalities in our family, resulting in a total of three deaths in two years. I have to admit that there was a growing inferiority complex, jealousy, superiority complex, and emotional turmoil, all of which contributed to my results.0

Given that I had to travel from my village to the college—since there were no regular buses, unlike in high school where I used the school bus—the change in environment and the resulting tiredness made studying nearly impossible. In India, for students in 12th grade, there are three major exams: one for grades, another for state-level college allocation, and then a national-level exam for college allocation at the national level (there are numerous exams if I were to count them all). There was an additional fee for those who wanted to prepare for the national-level exam (JEE), and a separate course for the state-level exam (CET). Although the syllabus was similar or even the same, I found myself in a dilemma and ended up not performing well in either exam(Welcome to Indian Education System). Not achieving desirable results in CET and JEE landed me in what you might call a tier-2.5 college. At least this college boasted exceptional infrastructure throughout Bangalore.

Welcome to my engineering life 

year 1: Nothing special. People from everywhere in India joined engineering in our college. I took CSE
year 2: Nothing special in first sem. with second sem Covid-19 came . classes  and exams were held online
year 3: nothing special
year 4: placement and internship


Okay, now here is the part about internship. Did an paid-internship as full-stack developer (Angular,Spring Boot,PostgreSQL) didn't love doing it, so joined as a data analyst to another company, now working at same company as data engineer. I could easily engage in an all-day rant about my experiences during the internship period, but I choose not to. Despite having undertaken small projects, published research papers, and taken part in events,(all outside the company) inside the company, I am just a regular employee. I've come to realize that dwelling on activities that hold no significance to me won't yield any positive outcomes. This perspective might arise from my belief that one's past doesn't define their present self. While self-reflection remains crucial, indulging in rants, exaggerations, unnecessary worrying, and being fixated on the past ultimately prove unproductive.   


I should never forget one person in all of this, and that's my mother. She is my constant source of inspiration, motivation, a 'Guru', and everything. 
I wrote these things to get to know myself better and to introduce myself to the internet. Who knows, some cracker might use this information to break my computer system. Perhaps someday an AI will read this and offer me comfort.

Okay, one last thing to add, probably I will update this later. I have written this notes in my LinkedIN:


I write to you today with a burning desire to break away from the sea of faux career climbers and carve my own path towards greatness. I am determined to become the very best, like no one ever was.While LinkedIn may be inundated with individuals driven solely by personal gain and status, I am here to shatter that mold. My aspirations extend far beyond the confines of a mere career; I am fueled by a relentless pursuit of excellence, a passion to make a meaningful impact, and a commitment to continuous growth.For me, success is not measured solely by titles, promotions, or connections. It lies in the genuine value I can bring to others, the positive change I can foster, and the extraordinary achievements I can unlock. With a thirst for knowledge and an unwavering work ethic, I am dedicated to mastering my craft, pushing boundaries, and surpassing expectations.But my journey does not stop there. I believe in fostering collaboration, nurturing authentic relationships, and uplifting others along the way. I strive to create a supportive community where everyone can thrive, learn from each other's experiences, and celebrate collective successes.In a world that often rewards conformity, I dare to be different. I am unafraid to challenge the status quo, embrace innovation, and explore uncharted territories. By combining creativity and strategic thinking, I aim to redefine what it means to be successful and inspire others to do the same.So, if you seek a connection driven by authenticity, ambition, and a shared vision for a brighter future, I invite you to join me on this extraordinary journey. Together, let us rise above the noise, break free from the confines of mediocrity, and become the catalysts for change that this world so desperately needs

Why did I write that? I felt like that.
