Hi, I’m Aditya Hebbar, a 23-year-old individual brimming with curiosity to explore the world and its various facets. When I say 'world,' I don't just mean Earth—usually, that was my limited interpretation of the term. I won't be sharing my image here; I have a strong aversion to that. But don't fret; if you're genuinely interested in knowing me, chances are you've already come across me on Twitter—that's me.

I intend to update this blog shortly (though finding sufficient time is challenging due to my office work and the ongoing process of shifting my house—just an excuse, perhaps). Until then, please bear with me. You can send me a direct message on Twitter. By now, you might even be growing bored after reading this much. Alright, let's leave it at that. these next things come by default, I will update them in the next update, bye bye
