Hi, I’m Aditya Hebbar, a 23-year-old individual brimming with curiosity to explore the world and its various facets. When I say 'world,' I don't just mean Earth—usually, that was my limited interpretation of the term. I won't be sharing my image here; I have a strong aversion to that. But don't fret; if you're genuinely interested in knowing me, chances are you've already come across me on Twitter—that's me.



I come from an Indian family, and as you may know, I hold certain beliefs. Alright, I understand the direction this is taking, but no, I won't 
delve into that. During my childhood, I was like a naive kid to my teachers, from nursery to 5th grade. (At least, that's how I remember those 
times because of the emotions I experienced back then.) Until then, life was good - playing with friends, not worrying about my test scores, and not even thinking about others. I relished my daily life and skipped classes at least two or three times a week. Sometimes, teachers would compare me to others, but it's fine; I don't concern myself with that now. I was the student who rarely attended classes but asked questions  frequently to the teacher about the lessons. One time, I was told not to ask questions in the middle of a lesson. Yeah, that's how it went. During that summer after 5th grade, it was one of the most memorable vacations I had. (I can't tell you the reason behind it at the moment.)
